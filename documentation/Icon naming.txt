Icon Naming
===========

Some things to keep in mind when choosing file names for icons:

- Use dashes "-", not underscores "_" or spaces " "
- Use a descriptive name that conveys what action, status or object your 
  icon represents, instead of describing what it looks like 
- Spell out all words, don't abbreviate any words to keep the meaning clear


State suffixes:

If an icon/widget is in a state where it's interacted with: use -active
If an icon/widget is in a toggled state: use -selected
If an icon/widget is in a toggled state and is interacted with: use -selected-active
