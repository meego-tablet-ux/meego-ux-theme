Contributing to the MeeGo UX Theme
==================================

This is a simple step by step process on how to get set up to
contribute to the MeeGo UX Theme. 

Please keep in mind that for contributed assets we need one for every resolution, so the
theme will work on any device.

Step 0-4 are a one-time process. Steps 5-9 are part of your daily workflow.


0. Get Git

     Mac:
     Install the package from http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list

     Fedora:
     "yum install git"

     Ubuntu:  
     "apt-get install git"


1. Get a Gitorious account

    You can sign up at http://www.gitorious.org/


2. Add your SSH public key to your account

    You can do this by going to your Dashboard and click "Manage
    SSH keys", then "Add SSH key". Run " open /Users/<USER>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    to see your public key. Paste it into the field on the website.

    If you don't have a SSH key pair yet, you can create one like this:
    "ssh-keygen -t RSA"


3. Fork the meego-ux-theme repository

    Go to https://meego.gitorious.org/meego-ux/meego-ux-theme
    and press the "Clone repository" button. This will make Gitorious
    create a personal copy of the repository for you on which you can
    work without having to have access to the "real" repository.

    Select either "Me" as the owner or a group of your choice.


4. Clone the repository locally

    You now have a personal repository called "<USER>s-meego-ux-theme".

    Clone it to your machine:
    "git clone git@gitorious.org:~<USER>/meego-ux/<USER>s-meego-ux-theme.git"

    Or with Tower:


    Or with SparkleShare:
    Select Gitorious and put in "" as the folder name.


5. Set up your contact info

    Add your details so others can see who made what changes.
    This is only needed if you're using the command line interface.

    "git config user.name Your Name"
    "git config user.email your@email.com"


5. Make your changes

    Start improving things.
    Commit the changes to your local copy:
    "git add --all"
    "git commit -m 'Tweak the slider widget'"

    Or on Tower:
    Click "Stage all" or tick the files you want to be added then
    click commit in the toolbar.

    Or on SparkleShare:
    You're already done! :)


7. Update your local copy

    If changes are made in the upstream repository, you will
    need to get them manually, to prevent conflicts in the future.

    To merge them in:
    "git pull --rebase git://gitorious.org/meego-ux/meego-ux-theme.git"


8. Send your changes to Gitorious

    "git push"

    Or on Tower:
    Click Push in the toolbar.

    Or on SparkleShare:
    You're already done! :)

    Now your changes are pushed to Gitorious for everyone to see.


9. Open a merge request

    Now you should make the maintainers of the MeeGo UX Theme aware
    of your changes, so they can merge them in.

    Go to your personal copy of the repository through the web
    interface, and click the "Request merge" button.

    All done!



===========================
Creating a package with OBS
===========================

1. In your cloned version of meego-ux-theme:

    - bump the version number in meego-theme-ux.pro
    qmake
    make dist


2. Get a checkout from OBS (don't do it in your git checkout):

    osc co devel:meego-ux meego-ux-theme


3. Set up your details (this is a one time step)

    - edit ~/.vcrc and add:
        username="your name"
        email="your email"
    EDITOR="path to your favourite editor"


4. Required steps to make a new release:

    - bump the version number in the .yaml file
    make
    make spec
    - delete the old .tar.gz
    - copy over the .tar.gz created in step 1
    osc ar && osc ci
    osc results

5. Look at results until you have succeeded. Now download and test your project (use other guides for this).

6. Now send this to trunk
	osc sr

7. Make a tag for the release in git:

    git tag "RELEASE_x.x.x"
    git push --tags

8. Now increment your version number in meego-ux-theme.pro

=========================================
Trying out your modifications on a tablet
=========================================

1.  Find out the IP address of the tablet:
    ifconfig on the command line or go to the Connections area in the settings and expand your connected device.
    
2.	Copy the files to the device using your favourite FTP application.
    Use the IP address you just discovered, port 22 (SFTP or SSH), and you username and password.
    Put them in /usr/share/themes/YOUR-RESOLUTION/YOUR-PATH

3.	Reboot and take a look.

==============================
Taking screenshots on a tablet

2. Make sure you are connected to your local network through the Connectivity settings panel

3. Go to the application that you would like to make a screenshot of 

3. Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 and log in

4. Install ImageMagick:

    zypper in ImageMagick

5. Take a screenshot:

    xwd -root -display :0 | convert - screenshot.png

6. Get the screenshot from your working machine connected to the local network:

    Find out the IP address of the tablet:
    ifconfig on the command line or go to the Connections area in the settings and expand your connected device.
    
    Now you can use your favourite FTP application to get the screenshot off the tablet.
    Use the IP address you just discovered, port 22 (SFTP or SSH), and you username and password.
    Now you can browse to /home/USERNAME/screenshot.png and copy it over.
