Contributing to the MeeGo UX Theme
==================================

This is a simple step by step process on how to get set up
to contribute to the MeeGo UX Theme.

Step 1-4 are a one-time process. Steps 5-9 are part of your daily
workflow.


1. Get a Gitorious account

    You can sign up at http://www.gitorious.org/


2. Add your SSH public key to your account

    You can do this by going to your Dashboard and click "Manage
    SSH keys", then "Add SSH key". Your SSH public key usually is
    "/Users/<USER>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub".

    If you don't have a SSH keypair yet, you can create one like this:
    "ssh-keygen -t RSA"


3. Fork the meego-ux-theme repository

    Go to https://meego.gitorious.org/meego-ux/meego-ux-theme
    and press the "Clone repository" button. This will make Gitorious
    create a personal copy of the repository for you on which you can
    work without having to have access to the "real" repository.

    Select either "Me" as the owner or a group of your choice.


4. Clone the repository locally

    You now have a personal repository called "<USER>s-meego-ux-theme".

    Clone it to your machine:
    "git clone git@gitorious.org:~<USER>/meego-ux/<USER>s-meego-ux-theme.git"

    Or use your favourite graphical client.


5. Set up your contact info

    Add your details so others can see who made what changes.

    "git config user.name Your Name"
    "git config user.email your@email.com"


5. Make your changes

    Start improving things.
    Commit the changes to your local copy:
    "git add --all"
    "git commit -m 'Tweak the slider widget'"

    Or use your favourite graphical client.


7. Update your local copy

    If changes are made in the upstream repository, you will
    need to get them manually, to prevent conflicts in the future.

    Do: 
    "git pull --rebase git://gitorious.org/meego-ux/meego-ux-theme.git"
    to merge them in.


8. Send your changes to Gitorious

    "git push"

    Or use your favourite graphical client.
    Now your changes are pushed to gitorious for everyone to see.


9. Open a merge request

    Now you should make the maintainers of the MeeGo UX Theme aware
    of your changes, so they can merge them in.

    Go to your personal copy of the repository throughout the web
    interface, and click the "Request merge" button.

    All done!
